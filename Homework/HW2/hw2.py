'''GUYS! Please chill on the work load.
I don't know how to write out this program and 
I've spent over 30 hours just trying to catch up on 
lab2 and homework2. 
The work load for this class is taking a huge toll on me, 
and its only the fourth week! 
I appreciate the core staff, but 
please make it easier for people who are enrolled 
in this class and are not in EE/CS.'''
